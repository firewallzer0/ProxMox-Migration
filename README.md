# ProxMox-Migration

These are a few small quick scripts I wrote for my homelab migration from VMware ESXi to ProxMox.

They are not build with error handling nor are they guaranteed to work. I declared a few variables but they don't have all the variables configured.

I am assuming you have the ovftool, from VMware downloaded and installed.
